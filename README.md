CombatRebalancer
----------------

Rebalances PvP combat in Minecraft. Currently this is not an all-in-one solution, and assumes that you're running other plugins to remove Protection and Sharpness enchantments.


Features:

* Nerfs weapon damage to draw out fights with unenchanted armor
* Configurable damage scaling factor in config.yml
* Optional dynamic player speed adjustments (unarmored players move faster than armored)
